	<p>The term "missile defence system" broadly means a system that provides any defence against any missile type( conventional or nuclear) by any country<br>
	Any mechanism which can detect and then destroy a missile before it can cause harm is called a missile defence system <b>( MDS).[ 2 ]</b> <br><br>
	The role of defence  agains nuclear missile has been haeated  military and political topics 
	for several decades.however,missile defense is no longer limited to interception of stratgic 
	nuclear wepon. The Gradual development and prolifeation of missile technology has blurred The
    line between the technologies for the interception of tratical missile(usually  short
	to intermediate range with non-nuclear payloads)  and the interception of startegic missile
	(usually long ranged with nuclear payloads).High performance tactical ballistic missile
	carrying non nuclear payloads now have the ability to affect strategic balance in conflict
	zones, likewise,high-performance tactical missile defence system can now influence force development strategiec.</p>

	<h2>  Air defence guns current and future relevance</h2>
	<p>Date:26-march-2023</p>

<p> It implies that the manufacture of the guns will start around 2033.Notionaly if 1000 guns are required
and rate of production is 24 guns/year then the last gun will be manufactured after about 42 year. 
This take the time line to 2075.

	<h3> <FONT COLOR="RED">UPGRADED SCHILKA WEAPON SYSTEM </FONT> </h3>
	
	<P>Guns became the primary means of countering air power when it raised its head at the turn
of the last century.Swedish guns manufacturing company befors came up with the ever green air defence
(AD) gun 40mm L/60.when caliber(40mm) was multiplied by 60-it gave the length of the barrel which was
240mm in this case this guns came into service during the second world war-around 1940 and was still
service in india till end of the century including on board indian Navy ships it successor was also
by bofors named 40mm L/70.</P>

       <h3><font color="red">Towed Guns </font> </h3> 
	  <p> <b> 40mm L/70 </b>. came into service  in india in 1964 just after the chinese debacle of 1962 
and just before the 1965 war with pakistan.it was the first modern guns which india acquired even when compared 
to field artilley.The guns was radar controlled with double the rate of fire of 40mm L/60,longer
range all weather and higher lethality The 40mm L/70 gun system which included the fire control
radar and generators for power supply  was nick name 'sudarshan chakra' as the gun folowed the targets
 automatically like the 'sudarshan chkra' Regrettably not many L/70 guns were in service by the time the 1971
war with pakistan commenced thus majority of pakistan aircraft kill were by L/60 guns the  L/70
guns has been upgrade joint ordanance factory jabalapur and bharat Electronics limited powerlay:
improved sighting system with laser range finder a thermal imager an onboard small computer and a
matching generator which makes a single gun to operate autonomously and also make it mobile.</p>

<h3><FONT COLOR="RED"> TUNGUSKA WEAPON SYSTEM </FONT> </H3>

<p><B> 23mm Twin Barrel Gun</b>. This gun is of soviet orgin and has been in service in india 
for about four decades.It is manual with a high rate of fire light weight and highly mobile
but is not all weather it was acquired the all weather air threat was not expected  during 
that time.it has been upgraded by bel the upgrade include and an electric power lay an improved 
sighting system which includes a laser range finder a thermal imager and a small computer It also 
has an on mounted generator thus making it an all weather system As a parallel effort punj lioyod has also upgrade one gun and finally won the bid to upgrades a selected number of guns</p>

	
	<h3><font color="red"> self-Propelled(SP) Gun system </font></h3>
     <p><b>Schilka System.</b> It is a highly mobile system for supporting the mechanised fornation and hasbeen in service since the early 70's.It was the first modern SP system in service in india whichwas highly mobile on a tracked chassis had a highly cyclic rate of fire of 3400 round per minutewith its four barrel on board fire control radar and power supply.limited numbers have been upgraded by BEL.the upgrade include a new fire control radar,computer,sighting system,a new engine and environmental control in the cabin</p>
	 
	 <p><b>Tunguska.</b> Shilka's successor was Tunguska, one regiment of which  was procured from Russia but there have been many twist and turns for buying additional mounts. The result is that the Army AD is struck with limited equipment which does not meet the current operational
	 reqirement.At some stages Army will run out of spares and the system will just collapse and 
	 became obsolete. </p>
	 
	 
	 <h3><font color="red"> Technological Development of AD guns</font></h3>
	 
	 <p> A fighter flying at about mach two speed and maneuvering in all the three dimensions is a very complex and difficult target to engage and destroy the sighting system were developed from simple ring sight (L/60); NIFE SR55 sight (L/70) and later on laser range finder and thermalimaging was included to provide more accurate range and limited night firing capability 
however lead of a moving target was still to be estimated manually which was still to be estimatedmanually which was not an accurate option The AD gun system moved on to fire contro radar but once the round left the muzzle error due to gravity and meteorplogical condition crept in.the russians tried to over cover this by hight rate of fire but this limited the calibre otherwise the gun would become too heavy the development of small size of radio fuze for small calibre AD ammunition further improved their accuracy Global trends are as follow </p> 
 
<p> <b>Skyshield of Rheinmentall Defence.</b> Not many guns system are currently available but a possible 
choice is skyshield of Rheinmetall Defence which has an effective range  of 4km and rate of fire of 1,000
rounds per minute.It can be matched with nay fire control radar and the most redeeming featureis its Ahead (advanced 
hit efficiently and destruction technology) ammunition which conatains 152heavy, tungsten metal spin stabilished
sub-projectiles and ejected by a time fuze It is claimed to be very effective against small targets 
however the company had come under the shadow of corruption and at present black listed by indian 
Government.</P>

<p><b>Railgun</b>.This revolutionary concept is being developed in US,china Russia,turkeyand india but US 
is farhead A railgunis a device that uses electromagnetic force to launch high at least 50per cent higher
velocity and much longer range than current system At present railgun is being examined fir use as AD 
and anti ship weapon however it is in its nascent stage and also need very high power supply thus employement 
as a towed/SP system for army is doutful in the near future.</p>

<img src="C:\Users\Sunil Kumar\Downloads\Screenshot_2023_0326_180917.png"class="img5">
 
 
 <h3><font color="red"> Employement of Gun system </font></h3>
<p>the guns have limited range of 3-4 km and are thus deployed ahead of the defended target so that the aircraft 
is engaged before it can attack the target this is called <b>Point defence in AD</b>
paralance.L/70 guns regiments are held by AAD and are deployed on strategic assest which include both civilian
(like nuclear plant strategic logist choke point etc.) and military assest of the army,navy and air force.
the assest are not mobile thus towed L/70system is more suited for them SP guns system 
being mobile are employed with mechanised formation.</p>  

<h3><font color="red"> Guns vs Missiles</font></h3>
<p> Cost wise gun is much cheaper than missile but by itself cannot match the current air 
threat of stealth aircraft flying at supersonic speed and armed with stand off weaponthus many
developed countries like US do not belive in guns and have developed very advance missile 
system which cover the whole threat envelope to include manned aircraft unmanned aircraft helicopter 
cruise and ballistic missile however majority of the countries with AD capability has deployed 
a healthy mix of gun and missile to acquire a cost effective solution.</p>
 
 
 <h3><font color="red"> Indian Perspective</h3></font>
<p>Armament Research Development Established (ARDE) of the DRDO is assigned the role of developing small
arms and guns for the Armed force but they have not been able to deliver as far  as AD guns are connected
ARDE was given a project about four decades but werenot successful thus the indian army is stuck with old 
guns system L/70 was being manufactured in gun carriage factory jablapur but the production line was closed 
due to want of demand there were still about 60 technicians skilled in L/70 till 2007 but they must have 
retired now the remaining gun system were all imported from erstwhile sovient union successor to L/70 is red hot 
priority other guns system that can follow as some of them(23 mm barrwl and achilka)have been given a limited leaser of life due to upgrade</P>
 
 
 <P><b>Successsor to L/70-Practicallity of Time Frame</b>. As already mentioned above that the guns has crosed
its golden jubilee thus the urgency to replace it cannot be over emphasised So far the acquistion
process has not started but one can estimate  that the process of defence procurement Procedure (DPP)
optimistically will take five year this will be followed by transfer of technology development of the system and 
it implies may take about 10 year thus it implies that the manufacture of the gun will start around 2023 
notionally if 1,000 guns are required and rate of production is 24guns/year then the last gun manufactured after
about 42 years this take the line to 2075  Considering the life of a gun to be 30years the last batch
of guns should last till 2105 and the replacement will be required for the earliest guns inducted from 2063
onward this process can be compressed if multiple companies take on the productiont this indicates that the 
inordinate delay in starting the replacement has cost point AD capability dearly development and production
of guns to be current till 2105 is completely unrealistic this time can be marginally reduced but with
past experience of acquistion times farmes it can  be said with some aurhority that the is likely 
to delay the reduction of time fames </P> 

<P><B>23mm Twin Barrel Gun</B> This system will meet the same fate if the process for its successor
is not initiated un a reasonable times frame </P>

<p><B> SP Gun System </b> As the number are small and if they are really required then the option
of import route can be taken</P>

<h3><font color="red"> Latest Procurement Initative</font></h3>
<p>As per media reports the Army has formally projected a requirement of 938 guns to replace in-service L/70
and  23mm Twin Barrel guns at an estimated cost of about $3 billion the route taken will be indian
Designed Developed and manufactured (IDDM) category of the DDP.Indian companies which could be in the
run areL&T tata ,kalyani defence punj Lloyod and mahindra defence ordnance factory should been in loop as they
have the infrastructure and the longest experience in producing defence equipment which is about 
100 years ordance  factory kanpur is probably the only guns and and tank barrel making factory in india To 
replicate their skilled.manpower  and infrastructure in private companies will take lot of resource  in time and money 
the above time frame should also be taken into account before a decision is taken to manufacture gun in india
the other connected factors are the fire control radar and the ammunition off course the time frame can be
reduced if more that one factory can taken on the production initiative had projected that all gun should 
be replce by december 1999. </P>
